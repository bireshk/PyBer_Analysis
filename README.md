# PyBer Analysis using Pandas, Jupyter and Matplotlib
## Overview analysis
The objective of this analysis is to determine the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for different city types like rural, suburban and urban. The analysis can help in various ways like:
1. what type of city can potentially generate more revenue
2. where the ride fare is legitimate based on demand 
3. where driver count increase might help 


## Results
From the below table it is very much clear that the average fare per ride and per driver is more in Rural cites compared to Suburban and Urban. This could be because the demand of rides in Rural cities are way less than Suburban or Urban. Also, because the demand for ride is less, the average fare in Rural cities are high comparatively.
On the other side, as per the table Urban cities are generating more revenue compared to Suburban or Rural. The numbers in the table shows that the number of rides in Suburban and Urban cities are 5 and 13 times more than Rural cities. Also, the total fare in Suburban and Urban cities are approximately 4.75 and 13 times more than Rural cities.

Below line graphs reflects the fare (in $) vs Month changes from Jan to Apr, 2019. Feb end (2019-02-24) shows highest increase in total fare for each type of cities:

## Summary
Below are the recommendation for the CEO:
1.	Average fare for rides in Rural cities could be reduced to make the rides more public friendly
2.	At the same time from the summary table we see the number of drivers in Urban cities are quite high compared to the demand (only 1625 total rides vs 2405 total drivers). This leads to the conclusion that number of drivers could be reduced in Urban cities and moved to Rural/Suburban cities after reducing the fare prices in Rural/Suburban, so that rides become more public choice
3.	While taking the above actions consider the population density of the type of the cities this will possibly give clearer picture of the long term business approach
